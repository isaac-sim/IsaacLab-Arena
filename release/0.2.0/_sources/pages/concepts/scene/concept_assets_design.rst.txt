Assets
======

Assets are the objects and backgrounds that make up a scene.
Arena ships with a set of assets ready to use by name,
and new assets can be added by registering them in the asset library.

.. code-block:: python

   background = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("kitchen")()
   cracker_box = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("cracker_box")()

Registering a new asset
-----------------------

To add a new object, subclass ``LibraryObject``, provide the USD path and object type,
and decorate it with ``@register_asset``:

.. code-block:: python

   @register_asset
   class MyObject(LibraryObject):
       name = "my_object"
       tags = ["object", "graspable"]
       usd_path = "path/to/my_object.usd"
       object_type = ObjectType.RIGID

Once registered, the object is available in the registry like any other asset:

.. code-block:: python

   obj = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("my_object")()

Assets can also be tagged to make them discoverable by category:

.. code-block:: python

   # All graspable objects
   objects = asset_registry.get_assets_by_tag("graspable")

   # A random graspable object
   obj = asset_registry.get_random_asset_by_tag("graspable")()

Useful tags include ``"graspable"``, ``"openable"``, ``"pressable"``, and ``"background"``.
Assets can have multiple tags — for example, a fruit is tagged both ``"graspable"`` and ``"food"``.

Object types
------------

Every asset has an object type that determines how it is simulated:

- **RIGID** — a single rigid body (boxes, bottles, tools, furniture).
- **ARTICULATION** — a multi-body object with joints (robots, doors, drawers, appliances).
- **BASE** — no physics; used for static backgrounds and markers.

Object references
-----------------

A background asset like a kitchen is a single USD file containing many prims:
countertops, shelves, drawers, and so on. To use one of these internal prims
as a destination or interaction target (e.g. "place the object on the counter"),
you use an ``ObjectReference``.

.. code-block:: python

   kitchen = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("kitchen")()

   counter = ObjectReference(
       name="kitchen_counter",
       prim_path="{ENV_REGEX_NS}/kitchen/counter_right_main_group/top_geometry",
       parent_asset=kitchen,
   )

   task = PickAndPlaceTask(
       pick_up_object=cracker_box,
       destination_location=counter,
       background_scene=kitchen,
   )

The ``parent_asset`` tells the environment which spawned USD the prim path belongs to.
The prim path uses ``{ENV_REGEX_NS}`` so it resolves correctly across parallel environments.
