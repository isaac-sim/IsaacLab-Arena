Policy
======

A policy in Arena is a standard interface between your model and the evaluation
pipeline. You implement one method — ``get_action(env, obs)`` — and the policy
plugs into both the single-job runner and the Experiment Runner without any
changes to either. In bare IsaacLab you would write an ad-hoc inference loop
for each model; Arena's ``PolicyBase`` gives a consistent contract that all
runners depend on.

.. code-block:: python

   policy = ZeroActionPolicy(config=ZeroActionPolicyCfg())
   obs, _ = env.reset()
   action = policy.get_action(env, obs)

Built-in policies
-----------------

Arena ships with four policies:

**ZeroActionPolicy** (``"zero_action"``)
   Returns a zero-filled action tensor. Useful for validating an environment
   without a trained model.

**ReplayActionPolicy** (``"replay"``)
   Replays actions from a recorded episode stored in an HDF5 file.

**RslRlActionPolicy** (``"rsl_rl"``)
   Runs inference with a trained RSL-RL checkpoint. Loads the checkpoint and
   its accompanying ``params/agent.yaml`` automatically.


Writing a custom policy
-----------------------

Define a typed ``PolicyCfg``, subclass ``PolicyBase`` with that config, set a
``name``, register it with its config, and implement ``get_action``:

.. code-block:: python

   from dataclasses import dataclass

   import gymnasium as gym
   import torch
   from gymnasium.spaces.dict import Dict as GymSpacesDict

   from isaaclab_arena.assets.register import register_policy
   from isaaclab_arena.policy.policy_base import PolicyBase, PolicyCfg


   @dataclass
   class MyPolicyCfg(PolicyCfg):
       device: str = "cuda:0"


   @register_policy
   class MyPolicy(PolicyBase[MyPolicyCfg]):
       name = "my_policy"

       def __init__(self, config: MyPolicyCfg):
           super().__init__(config)

       def get_action(self, env: gym.Env, observation: GymSpacesDict) -> torch.Tensor:
           # Your model inference here
           return torch.zeros(env.action_space.shape, device=torch.device(env.unwrapped.device))

Construct the policy by passing its typed configuration directly:

.. code-block:: python

   policy_cfg = MyPolicyCfg(device="cuda:0")
   policy = MyPolicy(policy_cfg)

The typed registration lets the single-job runner generate CLI flags from
``MyPolicyCfg`` and lets the Experiment Runner convert the current
``Job.policy_config_dict`` representation into that same type. See
:doc:`Arena Experiments <../concept_arena_experiments>` for details.

Config fields named ``device`` or ``num_envs`` reuse the corresponding shared
runner flags, so their defaults must match the runner defaults.

Camera-aware policies
---------------------

The optional ``PolicyBase`` hook ``needs_new_observation()`` lets Arena skip
rendering work that an image policy never uses. It returns whether the next
``get_action`` call reads its observation. Policies that replay a cached action
chunk return ``False`` while every environment still has actions left, and the
rollout then asks the environment to skip camera rendering for that step. The
default returns ``True``. Episode starts always render regardless of the hook.

The skip only pays off while every environment fetches its chunk on the same
step. The openpi and Cosmos remote policies keep fetches aligned by default
(``sync_chunk_fetches``): an environment reset in the middle of a chunk holds
its current pose for at most ``open_loop_horizon - 1`` steps and joins the next
shared fetch. GR00T offers the same behavior through its ``synced_batch``
action scheduler.

.. note::

   ``policy_runner.py`` remains an argparse frontend, but policies do not
   implement argparse methods. The runner generates their flags from the
   registered config and reconstructs it before creating the policy.
